Diamond Price Prediction
This is a project that uses machine learning to predict the price of diamonds based on various features such as carat, cut, color, and clarity. The project uses the Diamonds Prices2022.csv dataset, which was last updated on July 1, 2021 and published under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC BY 4.0) by M. Garside on the website Statista.

Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need to clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the main.py file to train and evaluate the machine learning model. The script will split the dataset into training and validation sets, encode the categorical features using one-hot encoding, and train a decision tree regressor on the training set. It will then evaluate the model using the mean absolute error metric and print the overall MAE to the console.

Usage
You can use this project as a template for building your own diamond price prediction models, or you can modify the existing code to fit your specific needs. To do so, you will need to make changes to the main.py file and any other files that you modify.
